##  modern data ecosystem:

type of data (structured, unstructured)

texts, images, clickstreams, user conversations, social media platforms, internet of things (LOT), 
real-time events that stream data, legacy databases.


1. pull a copy of data from sources into a data repository.
2. organize, clean up, and optimize data (conform to compliances and standards enforced in the organization)

Data hold the key to competitive advantage!

Roles of data engineers:

- extract, integrate, and organize data from different sources.
- clean, transform, and prepare data.
- design, store, and manage data.



Data engineering concerns the mechanics of the flow and access of data.
Make quality data available for fact-finding and data-driven decision-making.
- collecting source data
  data acquisition from multiple sources
  data architecture for storing source data (databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc)
  
- processing data
  implementing and maintaining distributed systems
  design pipelines for extraction, transformation, and loading data into data repositories.
  design and implement solutions for validating and safeguarding data quality, privacy, and security.
  optimize tools, systems, and workflows for performance, reliability, and scalability.
  ensure data meets all regulatory and compliance guidelines.

- storing data
  scalable systems
  data privacy, security, compliance, monitoring, backup, and recovery.

- making data available to users securely
  APIs, services, and programs that retrieve data.
  interfaces and dashboards
  checks and balances to ensure data security (right-based access to users)

Evolution of Data Engineering:
Big data
NoSQL
automation tools
cloud computing
data engineers work closely with developers to meet their requirements
wide column stores (Cassandra and HBase, key-value pair databases, hadoop, document stores such as mongoDB and Coachbase)
distributed computing
DevOps
ML models
